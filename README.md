motion-chart
============

Create a "Hans Rosling" style motion chart using D3.

Originally used for http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2012/11/rewired-state-uk-parliament-2012/

This demo project shows three UK political parties.

The axes are...

* X - Percentage of female MPs
* Y - Average age of MPs
* Radius - Number of MPs
* Temporal - Years
 
This repository mostly serves as a reminder of what I did.
